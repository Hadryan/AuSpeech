chandler, listen to me sweetie, i know you can do this. okay? you have a beautiful smile. i do? yeah!  all right, maybe you dont have to smile. lets try something else. lets try umm, try looking sexy. okay. where\\'s chandler?

well thats the best part. umm, wh-why is that the best part? because then i dont have to! well of im really not deciding! fine! it\\'s not just the drum noise. every five minutes, joey throws his sticks in the air, and i have to hear, \"oh my eye! oh god, my eye!\" i mean, it is so annoying. yes, thank you. you see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums. phoebe, you got joey drums to annoy rachel, so she wouldn\\'t wanna live there anymore?
